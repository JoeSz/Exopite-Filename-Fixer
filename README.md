SUPPORT/UPDATES/CONTRIBUTIONS
-----------------------------

If you use my program(s), I would **greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some suggestions/feedback**. If you solve some issue or fix some bugs or add a new feature, please share with me or mke a pull request. (But I don't have to agree with you or necessarily follow your advice.)

**Before open an issue** please read the readme (if any :) ), use google and your brain to try to solve the issue by yourself. After all, Github is for developers.

My **updates will be irregular**, because if the current stage of the program fulfills all of my needs or I do not encounter any bugs, then I have nothing to do.

**I provide no support.** I wrote these programs for myself. For fun. For free. In my free time. It does not have to work for everyone. However, that does not mean that I do not want to help.

I've always tested my codes very hard, but it's impossible to test all possible scenarios. Most of the problem could be solved by a simple google search in a matter of minutes. I do the same thing if I download and use a plugin and I run into some errors/bugs.
